# Intro to NumPy
NumPy is a popular Python library for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for working with arrays and matrices of data, as well as a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

## NumPy Functions
Before you can use it, you need to import NumPy into your python script.

```python
import numpy as np
```
## Creating NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists but can have multiple dimensions 
#### 1D NumPy Array
```python
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```


#### 2D NumPy Array
```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(matrix)
```
